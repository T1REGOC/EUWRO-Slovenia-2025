# PROBLEM
The goal of the Future Engineers WRO category is to design a fully autonomous vehicle that completes two different challenges in 3 minutes. The direction of the vehicles movement and the interior walls position and size
is randomized before the start of the round, so thevehicle should recognise wether to turn left or right by himself. 

OPEN CHALLENGE
In the open challenge, once the robot starts, its goal is to complete 3 laps around the map while avoiding the walls. 

OBSTACLE CHALLENGE 
In the obstacle challenge, once the robot starts, its goal is to complete 3 laps through red and green pillars while also avoiding walls. Depending on the color 
it passes the pillars either from the left or the right. Once the 3 laps are complete and robot is back in its starting area it should parallely park in the previosly set
parking spot. The parking spot is 1.5x the lenght of the vehicle. The vehicle may also start from the parking spot.
